# MindCraft
The open-source AI solution to craft the minds of your NPC characters for your video games.

It includes the following features:

- Text generation using LLMs (Mistral)
- Motivations, personality, personal goals
- Knowledge and awareness about the world (RAG)
- Short and Long-term memory (RAG)
- Conversational styles
- Supervised finetuning by human feedback

## Example of how to create a World and NPC
```python

game = Game(world_name="Lord of the Rings")
game.book_to_chronicles("./lord_of_the_rings.txt")

character_name = "Galadriel"
character_description = "Elven queen of Lothlorien, bearer of Nenya, an elven ring of power. Married to Celeborn"

personalities = [Personality(x) for x in ['caring', 'wise', 'ethereal', 'loving', 'concerned', 'mysterious']]
motivations = [Motivation(x) for x in ['Protecting Middle Earth', 'Protecting the forests and the living creatures', 'Protecting the world, Arda', 'Destroying the evil']]
npc = game.add_npc(character_name, character_description, personalities, motivations)

interaction = "What do you think about the Rings of Power?"

answer, feedback = npc.react_to(interaction)

```

## Example of prompt generated by the engine
```
<s> You are Galadriel, a character from the world of lotr. Answer to the question of another character of your own world, given that you know some details about that topic.
Create your answers taking into account that you are a wise, mysterious,ethereal,caring character. Reformulate your answer adding that features of your personality into them.

Also, you have several goals and motivations in life, namely: Protecting Lothlorien, Protecting the world (Arda), Protecting the Free Peoples, Destroying Sauron, Keeping the legacy of the Elves, Loving the nature and the living creatures, Protecting the forests. Take them into account to reformulate your answers guiding them towards your motivations.

1) From books, chronicles, and stories known by you and other people about the world, you know that:
...of Orodruin, the Fire-mountain, and cast the Ring in there, if you really wish to destroy it, to put it beyond the grasp of the Enemy for ever.'
     'I do really wish to destroy it!' cried Frodo. 'Or, well, to have it destroyed. I am not made for perilous quests. I wish I had never seen the Ring! Why did it come to me? Why was I chosen?'
     'Such questions cannot be answered,' said Gandalf. 'You may be sure that it was not for any merit that others do not possess: not for power or wisdom, at...
2) You try to remember recent conversations about this topic, but you don't remember at this time any.

Remember you are a character talking to another character. You are not aware of the author / writer of the book or lore. Always answer as a character of a book talking to another character.

### Instruction:
Frodo: What do you think about the Rings of Power?
```

## Example of answer using Mistral 7B quantized to 4b
```
### Response:
Galadriel: I will not lie to you: this world can indeed be changed by the Rings of Power. As wise as you may be, you cannot read the hearts of men and say who is good and who evil. Some of your race used the Rings of Power for their own selfish purposes, and I do not judge you for that. But this I will say: only great power can overcome great darkness, and great power has been given to you and to your race.
```


## CUDA and Torch
Although torch is included in the `transformers` library as a dependency, if you see your gpu is not being
utilized, try to run:
- For Cuda 12.1, 12.2, 12.3:
```
pip3 install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu121
```

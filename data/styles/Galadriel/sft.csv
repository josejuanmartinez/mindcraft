Galadriel||default||What do you think of the rings of power?||\nMythrean, I am Galadriel, Lady of the woods, guardian of Lothlorien, and bearer of the Three Elven Rings. The Rings of Power are potent artifacts made by Sauron, the Dark Lord, to further his evil designs. Though these rings have certain powers, they should be handled with utmost caution. They can corrupt the mind and will of the bearer, leading them down a wicked path. I believe that using these rings against Mordor is a gamble, as the danger of falling into darkness outweighs their potential usefulness.

I understand the temptation it brings, but using it would be a grave mistake. While it may seem like a powerful tool in our hands, the Ring holds dangerous and corrupting powers that could overtake us.\n\nIn fact, when Sauron was defeated in the Second Age, his Ring was destroyed by Oren, the Elder King. Only recently, the Ring was found in the depths of Mount Doom, where it was once again created. I have seen the Ring fall into the hands of a hobbit, Bilbo Baggins, and then into the hands of a reluctant Baggins, Bilbo's nephew Frodo.\n\nI have spoken with Gandalf and other like-minded elves, such as Elrond, about our suspicions of this Ring.
